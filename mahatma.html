            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, often hailed as the father of the Indian independence movement,and apparently was an extraordinary figure whose philosophy was to promote idea of "non-violence". While his unwavering commitment to peaceful resistance is well-known, there are lesser-known aspects of Gandhi's life that shed light on the complexities of his beliefs and actions. In this blog post, we will explore how Gandhi, despite advocating for non-violence, supported the British Empire in recruiting Indian soldiers during World War I and World War II, ultimately leading to the loss of Indian lives.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">World War 1</h3>
            <p>When World War I broke out in 1914, Britain called upon its colonies, including India, for support. Gandhi, who believed that India's support would grant it political leverage in the future, launched a recruitment campaign to encourage Indians to join the British army. Around 1.5 million Indian soldiers enlisted during the war, and tragically, more than 74,000 lost their lives.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">World War 2</h3>
            <p>During World War II, Gandhi once again urged Indians to support the British war effort, even as the Indian National Congress adopted a stance of non-cooperation with the colonial administration. Gandhi believed that India's active involvement in the war would strengthen its case for independence after the conflict ended. Over two million Indian soldiers joined the British forces during World War II, with a staggering death toll of approximately 87,000.</p>

            <p>In the 1937 Congress presidential election, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a prominent leader and a close associate of Gandhi, emerged as the front-runner against Nehru. Despite Patel's popularity and overwhelming support, Gandhi expressed his unwavering trust in Nehru, endorsing him as the future leader of the Congress.

            <p>The 1946 Congress presidential election witnessed a contest between Nehru and Pattabhi Sitaramayya.
